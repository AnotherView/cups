Read the file \"INSTALL.txt\"\r\ninstead...\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n    CUPS is a standards-based, open source printing system developed by Apple\r\n    Inc. for OS® X and other UNIX®-like operating systems.  CUPS uses the\r\n    Internet Printing Protocol (\"IPP\") and provides System V and Berkeley\r\n    command-line interfaces, a web interface, and a C API to manage printers and\r\n    print jobs.  It supports printing to both local (parallel, serial, USB) and\r\n    networked printers, and printers can be shared from one computer to another,\r\n    even over the Internet!\r\n\r\n    Internally, CUPS uses PostScript Printer Description (\"PPD\") files to\r\n    describe printer capabilities and features and a wide variety of generic\r\n    and device-specific programs to convert and print many types of files.\r\n    Sample drivers are included with CUPS to support many Dymo, EPSON, HP,\r\n    Intellitech, OKIDATA, and Zebra printers.  Many more drivers are available\r\n    online and (in some cases) on the driver CD-ROM that came with your printer.\r\n\r\n    CUPS is licensed under the GNU General Public License and GNU Library\r\n    General Public License versions 2.  See the file \"LICENSE.txt\" for more\r\n    information.\r\n\r\n\r\nREADING THE DOCUMENTATION\r\n\r\n    Once you have installed the software you can access the documentation (and\r\n    a bunch of other stuff) online at:\r\n\r\n\thttp://localhost:631/\r\n\r\n    If you're having trouble getting that far, the documentation is located\r\n    under the \"doc/help\" directory.\r\n\r\n    Please read the documentation before asking questions.\r\n\r\n\r\nGETTING SUPPORT AND OTHER RESOURCES\r\n\r\n    If you have problems, READ THE DOCUMENTATION FIRST!  We also provide many\r\n    discussion forums which are available at:\r\n\r\n\thttp://www.cups.org/newsgroups.php\r\n\r\n    See the CUPS web site at \"http://www.cups.org/\" for other resources.\r\n\r\n\r\nSETTING UP PRINTER QUEUES USING YOUR WEB BROWSER\r\n\r\n    CUPS includes a web-based administration tool that allows you to manage\r\n    printers, classes, and jobs on your server.  Open the following URL in your\r\n    browser to access the printer administration tools:\r\n\r\n\thttp://localhost:631/admin/\r\n\r\n    DO NOT use the hostname for your machine - it will not work with the default\r\n    CUPS configuration.  To enable administration access on other addresses,\r\n    check the \"Allow Remote Administration\" box and click on the \"Change\r\n    Settings\" button.\r\n\r\n    You will be asked for the administration password (root or any other user in\r\n    the sys/system/root/admin/lpadmin group on your system) when performing any\r\n    administrative function.\r\n\r\n\r\nSETTING UP PRINTER QUEUES FROM THE COMMAND-LINE\r\n\r\n    CUPS works best with PPD (PostScript Printer Description) files.  In a pinch\r\n    you can also use System V style printer interface scripts.\r\n\r\n    CUPS includes several sample PPD files you can use:\r\n\r\n\tDriver                         PPD Name\r\n\t-----------------------------  ------------------------------\r\n\tDymo Label Printers            drv:///sample.drv/dymo.ppd\r\n\tIntellitech Intellibar         drv:///sample.drv/intelbar.ppd\r\n\tEPSON Stylus Color Series      drv:///sample.drv/stcolor.ppd\r\n\tEPSON Stylus Photo Series      drv:///sample.drv/stphoto.ppd\r\n\tEPSON Stylus New Color Series  drv:///sample.drv/stcolor2.ppd\r\n\tEPSON Stylus New Photo Series  drv:///sample.drv/stphoto2.ppd\r\n\tEPSON 9-pin Series             drv:///sample.drv/epson9.ppd\r\n\tEPSON 24-pin Series            drv:///sample.drv/epson24.ppd\r\n\tGeneric PCL Laser Printer      drv:///sample.drv/generpcl.ppd\r\n\tGeneric PostScript Printer     drv:///sample.drv/generic.ppd\r\n\tHP DeskJet Series              drv:///sample.drv/deskjet.ppd\r\n\tHP LaserJet Series             drv:///sample.drv/laserjet.ppd\r\n\tOKIDATA 9-Pin Series           drv:///sample.drv/okidata9.ppd\r\n\tOKIDATA 24-Pin Series          drv:///sample.drv/okidat24.ppd\r\n\tZebra CPCL Label Printer       drv:///sample.drv/zebracpl.ppd\r\n\tZebra EPL1 Label Printer       drv:///sample.drv/zebraep1.ppd\r\n\tZebra EPL2 Label Printer       drv:///sample.drv/zebraep2.ppd\r\n\tZebra ZPL Label Printer        drv:///sample.drv/zebra.ppd\r\n\r\n    Run the \"lpinfo -m\" command to list the available drivers:\r\n\r\n        lpinfo -m\r\n\r\n    Run the \"lpinfo -v\" command to list the available printers:\r\n\r\n        lpinfo -v\r\n\r\n    Then use the correct URI to add the printer using the \"lpadmin\" command:\r\n\r\n        lpadmin -p printername -E -v device-uri -m ppd-name\r\n\r\n    Network printers typically use \"socket\" or \"lpd\" URIs:\r\n\r\n        lpadmin -p printername -E -v socket://11.22.33.44 -m ppd-name\r\n        lpadmin -p printername -E -v lpd://11.22.33.44/ -m ppd-name\r\n\r\n    The sample drivers provide basic printing capabilities, but generally do not\r\n    exercise the full potential of the printers or CUPS.  The CUPS web site\r\n    provides links and drivers:\r\n\r\n        http://www.cups.org/ppd.php      PPD files\r\n\thttp://www.cups.org/links.php    Links to other drivers\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINTING FILES\r\n\r\n    CUPS provides both the System V \"lp\" and Berkeley \"lpr\" commands for\r\n    printing:\r\n\r\n\tlp filename\r\n\tlpr filename\r\n\r\n    Both the \"lp\" and \"lpr\" commands support printing options for the driver:\r\n\r\n\tlp -o media=A4 -o resolution=600dpi filename\r\n\tlpr -o media=A4 -o resolution=600dpi filename\r\n\r\n    CUPS recognizes many types of images files as well as PDF, PostScript,\r\n    HP-GL/2, and text files, so you can print those files directly rather than\r\n    through an application.\r\n\r\n    If you have an application that generates output specifically for your\r\n    printer then you need to use the \"-oraw\" or \"-l\" options:\r\n\r\n\tlp -o raw filename\r\n\tlpr -l filename\r\n\r\n    This will prevent the filters from misinterpreting your print\r\n    file.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEGAL STUFF\r\n\r\n    CUPS is Copyright 2007-2012 by Apple Inc.
